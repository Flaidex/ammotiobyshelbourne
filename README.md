# ammotiobyshelbourne

A Flutter project.

## Getting Started

Ammotio is a mobile app that Shelbourne Accountants will offer to their contractor customers so they can view bank details, payslips, and manage and submit their expenses.

The app works as an integrated system where the accountants will review and load customer details, payslips, and review and approve expenses. It is a combination of read only areas (bank, payslips, hours worked) and actionable area (basic details, enter and submit expenses).
